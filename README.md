# 👋 Hi, I’m Leean  
- 🌱 A lifetime learner.
- https://saveker.org/leean
- 🐍 I sharpen my Python skills by building small games. It becomes a recent addiction for me. 
- 🌐 I like bringing ideas to life end-to-end — from coding websites, app to polishing the final design.  
- 📱 Currently pouring (weekend) energy into building my first iOS app.  
- 🎯 My 100-day coding challenge is where I test, fail, learn, and grow — one project at a time.
✨ Fun fact: Nothing excites me more than seeing a side project evolve into something real and usable.
